Hi! I am a fifth year student of [http://cse.iitk.ac.in/acad/dualdegree.html Dual Degree Program] (BTech--MTech) in [http:http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/ Department of Computer Science \& Engineering], [http://iitk.ac.in/ IIT Kanpur]. My research interest includes the whole of Theoretical Computer Sciences with special emphasis on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory Automata Theory] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm Approximation Algorithms]. I wish to pursue doctoral studies after graduation.

I am presently doing master's thesis under the supervision of [http://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/skmehta/ Prof S K Mehta]. The thesis is in the field of approximation algorithms. Specifically speaking, we are looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity parametrized algorithms] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernelization kernelization] techniques for $\textup{NP}-$Hard optimization problems. In my other avatars, I was an intern at [http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/ LSV], [http://www.ens-cachan.fr/version-anglaise/ ENS Cachan] where I worked towards developing a robust theory for Parametrized Communicating Automata (PCA).
