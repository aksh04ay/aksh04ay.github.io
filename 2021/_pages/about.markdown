I am a Senior Software Engineer at Sumo Logic working on data ingestion pipelines.

Before that, I was working at Google where I worked on various problems.
Long before that, I was a student at IIT Kanpur where I did bachelor's and master's in Computer Science.

I have an old, mostly outdated, webpage maintained [here][old].
